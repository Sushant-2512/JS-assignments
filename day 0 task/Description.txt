1. Garbage Collection :- It is a mechanism in which Garbage collector collects unrequired memory and release it this aumtomation of memory deallocation id called Garbage collection.

It uses 'Mark and sweep algorithm' it checks the number of references to particular memory and release it when references became 0.

Arrow function                                                                       statement function

1.Arrow function are of expression type                                           1. function are of statement type
2. they are introduced after ES6                                                  2. they are from start
3. Hoisting is applied on this                                                    3. Hoisting is not applied on this
4. Arrow function don't have their own this pointer                               4. this function have thier own this pointer
5. Arrow function this pointer pointing to their parent                           5.  this function poiting to their own this pointer
6. They don't have thier own argument list                                        6. they have their own argument list


3. Hoisting :- This is the mechanism by which we can use variables before intializing it.


4. Temporal dead zone :- we can't access the let before declearing it so that part of code is temporal dead zone.

5. 
script tag :- HTML parsing is stopped while loading the script from the network and executing it
script tag async :- HTML parsing is not stopped cause loading of script is done asynchronously but execution stops the HTML parsing.
script tag deffer :- HTML parsing is not stopped from both the time cause the loding is done parllelly and execution is done after the HTML parsing.

6.  Reduce function is used to get paraticular result from the array
